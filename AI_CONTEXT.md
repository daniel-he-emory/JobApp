# AI Conversation Summary

## Goal
To architect, build, and extend a sophisticated, end-to-end autonomous agent for applying to jobs.

## AI Roles & Workflow
This project utilizes a multi-agent development model to ensure efficiency and architectural integrity.

*   **Architect (Gemini):** Responsible for:
    *   Understanding user requirements.
    *   Designing the system architecture and planning the development roadmap.
    *   Preparing the codebase for parallel development (e.g., creating stubs, updating shared files).
    *   Providing clear, labeled prompts for the builder AI(s).
    *   Reviewing and integrating the code generated by the builders.

*   **Builder (Claude):** Responsible for:
    *   Writing Python code based on the specific prompts provided by the Architect.
    *   Working on isolated components in parallel with other Claude instances when instructed.

*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Architect (Gemini)** defines the task and prepares the codebase.
    2.  **Architect (Gemini)** provides distinct prompts labeled for "Claude A," "Claude B," etc.
    3.  **User** gives these prompts to the respective Claude instances.
    4.  **Builders (Claude)** generate the code for their assigned components.
    5.  **Architect (Gemini)** integrates the generated code and verifies the result.

*   **Context Management:**
    *   When updating this `AI_CONTEXT.md` file, the Architect (Gemini) must **append or update** relevant sections rather than overwriting the entire file, preserving the history and structure.

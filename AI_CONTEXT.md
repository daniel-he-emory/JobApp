# AI Conversation Summary

## Goal
The user wants to architect a sophisticated, end-to-end autonomous agent for applying to jobs.

## AI Roles
*   **Architect (Gemini):** Responsible for understanding the requirements, designing the system architecture, planning the development roadmap, and providing clear prompts for the builder.
*   **Builder (Claude):** Responsible for writing the Python code based on the prompts provided by Gemini and the user.

2.  The user assigned Gemini the role of AI engineering architect.
3.  Gemini was asked to update the `README.md` file with the project details.
4.  Gemini updated the `README.md` to reflect the project's vision.
5.  The user clarified the target audience for the tool, and Gemini updated the `README.md` accordingly.
6.  The user requested to save the conversation context.

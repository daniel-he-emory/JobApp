# AI Conversation Summary

## Goal
The user wants to design and build a sophisticated, end-to-end autonomous agent for applying to jobs.

## Conversation Flow
1.  The user provided a detailed prompt outlining the project requirements for a job application agent. The agent should be written in Python using Playwright, be modular, handle Greenhouse email verification, use proxies, and manage state.
2.  The user requested that I act as an AI engineering architect to help design the project.
3.  I was asked to update the `README.md` file with the project details.
4.  I updated the `README.md` to reflect the project's vision.
5.  The user clarified the target audience for the tool, and I updated the `README.md` accordingly.
6.  The user requested to save the conversation context.

## Previous Context
The initial context involved cloning the `JobApp` repository from GitHub and setting up aliases. That context is now superseded by the new project direction.
